# Stonehill CSC321 Final Projects

This repository is set up to deploy to https://stonehill-csc321.github.io. If you add your data and dashboard code to this repository, it will be on the Internet.

### Instructions for Adding your Dashboard

One member of your group should take responsibility for interacting with Github. If no one on your team has used github before, let me know.

1. If you haven't already, create a github account: https://github.com/signup
2. If you are on a windows computer and haven't done so already: download [Git for windows](https://gitforwindows.org/). 

3. If you are comfortable using the terminal, use `git clone git@github.com:stonehill-csc321/stonehill-csc321.github.io.git`. If not, use [Github desktop](https://desktop.github.com/download/) to clone https://github.com/stonehill-csc321/stonehill-csc321.github.io
4. Put the files from your project into the folder corresponding to your project name, then `git add`, `git commit` and `git push` the files. If you're unsure how to do that, come to my office hours.
5. After pushing, wait ~2 minutes then check https://stonehill-csc321.github.io to see your project deployed!
