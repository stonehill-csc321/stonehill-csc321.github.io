We decided to change some parts of our dashboard from the low-fidelity prototype. 
The first change we made was to put the two graphs about divisions side by side instead of on top of each other. 
This was our original idea, and we went back to it because we thought it would make more sense to have them next to each other because they are about divisions, and they are connected by the same dropdown menu. 
The next change we made was to switch from a search bar to a drop-down menu for the first graph. 
We did this because we were having a hard time making the search bar and because they both would accomplish the same goal.
